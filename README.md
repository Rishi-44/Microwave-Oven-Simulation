## 📖 Overview
This project is a fully functional **Microwave Oven Simulation** developed during my Embedded Systems Internship at **Emertxe Technologies**. The system is built on the **PIC16F877A** microcontroller and simulates the core operations of a real-world microwave oven, including multiple cooking modes, temperature control, and safety mechanisms.

The project demonstrates the implementation of **Finite State Machines (FSM)**, **Interrupt Service Routines (ISR)**, and peripheral interfacing (CLCD, Matrix Keypad, Timers).

## 🚀 Features
The system supports four distinct operational modes:

1.  **Micro Mode:**
    * Standard cooking mode with a default power setting of 900W.
    * User-defined cooking duration.
    * Fan (Magnetron) and Timer activation.
2.  **Grill Mode:**
    * Simulates high-heat grilling operations.
    * Timer-based countdown without temperature control.
3.  **Convection Mode:**
    * Includes a specialized **Pre-Heating Cycle** (60 seconds).
    * Allows temperature selection before cooking begins.
4.  **Quick Start Mode:**
    * One-touch activation for an instant 30-second cooking cycle.
    * "Add Time" feature: Pressing Start again adds +30 seconds dynamically.

**🛡️ Safety Features:**
 **Door Interlock:** The system pauses immediately via ISR if the door is opened (simulated interrupt).
